I recently stumbled across <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1849967202/" target="_blank">The Algorithm Design Manual</a> &#8211; a textbook written by <a href="http://algorist.com/" target="_blank">Steven Skiena</a>, a professor at Stony Brook University &#8211; looking for a way to brush up on my computer science skills.

After checking it out, and based largely on the recommendation <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Steve Yegge</a> made in his <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html" target="_blank">Get that job at Google</a> post, I decided to go through <a href="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~skiena/373/" target="_blank">the author&#8217;s course</a>.

Seeing as I don&#8217;t actually have a teacher or classmates to discuss ideas, comments, and questions, I thought I&#8217;d blog about my experience and hopefully to able to discuss the material with interested people. There have been many blogs which have cataloged a person&#8217;s journey through a book or course &#8211; <a href="http://eli.thegreenplace.net/category/programming/lisp/sicp/" target="_blank">Eli Bendersky&#8217;s</a> series tackling SICP being one that came out particularly well. I hope to add another interesting one.

I&#8217;m planning on following the course pretty closely. I&#8217;ll be reading the assigned pages, watching the <a href="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~algorith/video-lectures/" target="_blank">available lectures</a>, and posting my solutions to homework. In addition, I&#8217;ll be posting weekly reflections and insights I gained that week &#8211; the first one&#8217;s coming this Sunday. I apologize in advance if I fall a little behind &#8211; I&#8217;m doing all this after I get home from my day job.

I want to reiterate the fact that I am a student of this material &#8211;  of all things really &#8211; and so I&#8217;ll use this space to think and ask questions &#8220;out loud.&#8221;

That said, I hope I can make this little interesting for you.
