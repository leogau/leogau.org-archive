***Takeaway: It&#8217;s the people that matter. Nothing else.***

The state of the economy doesn&#8217;t matter much either way.

If we&#8217;ve learned one thing from funding so many startups, it&#8217;s that they succeed or fail based on the qualities of the founders. Which means that what matters is who you are, not when you do it. If you&#8217;re the right sort of person, you&#8217;ll win even in a bad economy. And if you&#8217;re not, a good economy won&#8217;t save you.

So if you want to improve your chances, you should think far more about who you can recruit as a cofounder than the state of the economy. And if you&#8217;re worried about threats to the survival of our company, don&#8217;t look for them in the news. Look in the mirror.

If you have a specific idea you want to act on, act now.

That doesn&#8217;t mean you can ignore the economy. Both customers and investors will be feeling pinched. It&#8217;s not necessarily a problem if customers feel pinched: you may even be able to benefit from it, by making things that save money.

Fortunately the way to make a startup recession-proof is to do exactly what you should do anyway: run it as cheaply as possible. The immediate cause of death in a startup is always running out of money. So the cheaper your company is to operate, the harder it is to kill. And fortunately it has gotten very cheap to run a startup. A recession will if anything make it cheaper still.

Customers may drop off individually if they can no longer afford you, but you&#8217;re not going to lose them all at once; markets don&#8217;t &#8220;reduce headcount.&#8221;

Good hackers can always get some kind of job. It might not be your dream job, but you&#8217;re not going to starve.

Another advantage of bad times is that there&#8217;s less competition.

It&#8217;s hard to say whether advantages like lack of competition outweigh disadvantages like reluctant investors. But it doesn&#8217;t matter much either way. It&#8217;s the people that matter. And for a given set of people working on a given technology, the time to act is always now.
