[I was] more interested in being a public intellectual than being a scholar. And what I mean by public intellectual is someone who helps us as individuals and as a society figure out both who we are currently and who we should be.

One of the pluses of creating businesses is that you can weld it with a capital model because if you can create a sustainable, profitable business it theoretically lives forever. [You] have a force that makes change in the world.

Think of entrepreneurship as investing.

There are 3 basic strategies for investing:

  1. Sure bets &#8211; you have some kind of edge (resources, inside information&#8230;)
  2. Low risk &#8211; Not good for entrepreneurship. You don&#8217;t *&#8220;Jump off the cliff and assemble the plane on the way down.&#8221;*
  3. Accurate, contrarian &#8211; pick something most people aren&#8217;t doing.

A metaphor for entrepreneurship: Scuba diving &#8211; you&#8217;re at the bottom and only a limited amount of oxygen. The question you ask is, which way is the surface and how long do I have to get there.

Principles of entrepreneurship

  1. **Work as if you&#8217;re going to succeed but, plan on the fact that you might actually fail.** Get to your failure points and get to them as early as you can. What&#8217;s the central test of whether this succeeds or not and how can I get there fast?
  2. **Time matters.** Sometimes you&#8217;ll get lucky and sometimes you won&#8217;t. If your time cycles are too long, you&#8217;ll have less chance to catch the right wave.
  3. **It&#8217;s about controlled risk**
  4. **In business, it&#8217;s about taking the easiest, simplest problem you can solve and scale.**
  5. **The fundamental strategy of a startup is not product or sales strategy, it&#8217;s financing strategy.** If you&#8217;re under-capitalized relative to your competitors, you&#8217;re screwed.

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 16px; color: #444444; font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; line-height: 24px;">There are 3 skill types that are part of a founding team:</span>

  1. Technologist &#8211; you can build it
  2. Product person &#8211; you know what you&#8217;re delivering to the customer.
  3. General manager

In real estate, it&#8217;s location, location, location.

In consumer internet &#8211; the key is distribution, distribution, distribution

3 Stages of a startup:

  1. v0 &#8211; v1
  2. v1 &#8211; v1.1
  3. v1.1 &#8211; v2

Each stage requires fundamentally different skill-sets.

Entrepreneurship is very important because every modern career is heading toward entrepreneurship. You&#8217;re being a small business, entrepreneur even if you&#8217;re working within a company. The skill learned from entrepreneurship are applicable to any career path.
