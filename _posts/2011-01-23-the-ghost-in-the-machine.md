**Chapters 1 -2 of The Algorithm Design Manual**

These chapters introduce what algorithms are and how to analyze them. This is basic Algorithms 101 stuff &#8211; what is an algorithm, correctness and efficiency, examples of Big O/Omega/Theta notation, worst/best/average-case complexity, etc. I don&#8217;t want to rehash this material as there are other, better places for that.

I do want to discuss one idea that really charmed me.

**What is an algorithm?**

Technically, algorithms are procedures that accomplish a specific, well-defined task. While true, this is a dry, formal, and uninteresting definition.

In describing what an algorithm is, Skiena says,

> &#8220;Algorithms are the ideas behind computer programs.&#8221;

What a beautiful statement. I love that way of looking at algorithms. I love the idea that algorithms are the heart and soul of programs. They&#8217;re the core &#8211; constant despite language, location, and hardware. I&#8217;ve never heard of algorithms described this way. All of a sudden, constructing algorithms stops being this boring way to solve problems in a textbook and becomes a process of discovering the *life force* of a computer program.

In the past, I knew that a program was executing a set of instructions and that set of instructions was conceived by humans &#8211; but this is a cold, heartless worldview. Those &#8220;set of instructions&#8221; are the *idea* behind a program. There&#8217;s another level of depth here.

In my mind, this crystalizes what algorithms really are. Hidden behind the code, they are the drivers of how to solve a particular problem &#8211; they are the ghosts in the machine.

I know that this post may be too grandiose but, I think I&#8217;m so attracted to this because the word &#8216;idea&#8217; has such a romantic meaning to me. A great idea has the power to change the world.

In one sentence, algorithms have just been given that power.
